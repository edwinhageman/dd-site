## README

### Project info
- backend api sourcetree in `src/main/java`
- frontend sourcetree in `src/main/frontend`
- ts backend api client is generated by the openapi-generator-maven-plugin based on the openapi.json spec created by
  springdoc-openapi-maven-plugin.
  for now use `bin/generate-api-client.sh` to generate a new openapi.json spec when changing the backend api. (should be
  automated in the build process)

### Development config

- docker is managed by spring
- run backend with spring profile `local`

- frontend dev server runs on port 3000

when changing ports, remember to change the proxy configuration in `vite.config.ts`.
