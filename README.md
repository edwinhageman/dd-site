## README

### Project info

Small tool to manage dinner parties and keep track of recipes and wine pairings.

### Development config

- backend api sourcetree in `src/main/java`
- frontend sourcetree in `src/main/frontend`
- ts backend api client is generated by the openapi-generator-maven-plugin based on the openapi.json spec created by
  springdoc-openapi-maven-plugin.
  for now use `bin/generate-api-client.sh` to generate a new openapi.json spec when changing the backend api. (should be
  automated in the build process)
- spring manages docker development container(s)
- backend api runs on port 8080 (run DdSiteApplication with spring profile `local`)
- frontend dev server runs on port 3000 (start with `npm run dev` in `src/main/frontend`)
- when changing ports, remember to change the proxy configuration in `vite.config.ts`.

- run api with spring profile `prod`
- provide the following environment variables
  - DB_URL
